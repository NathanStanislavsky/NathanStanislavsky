## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathan Stanislavsky and I am student at Boston University studying math and computer science. I am currently working on a workout tracker app using Sveltekit, Node, Neon Serverless Postgres, Prisma, and Tailwind. My last project, which I would like to revisit, is a bitboard chess engine written in C++, and before that was a fullstack Tetris web application using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
