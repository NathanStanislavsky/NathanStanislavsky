## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathan Stanislavsky and I am student at Boston University studying math and computer science. I am currently working on Pantry which uses ingredients you input to find relevant recipes. I am developing this using my favorite tech stack -- Sveltekit, Node.js, Postgres, and Tailwind. My last projects include a workout tracker, tetris web application using the MERN stack and a chess engine written in C++. I'm excited to continue learning and expanding my skillset in full stack development.
